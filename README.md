# EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE HOTEL BOOKING DATASET
This project explores hotel booking data to derive insights on guest behavior, booking patterns, and hotel performance metrics using SQL queries. It includes practical SQL scripts to extract, transform, and analyze booking data, allowing for an in-depth look at factors like guest demographics, booking trends, and operational efficiencies.

Summary of Key Analysis

1. Guest Demographics and Preferences
   - Extract initials and full names for streamlined guest identification.
   - Standardize hotel names and categorize by types for consistent reporting.
2. Booking Patterns and Metrics
   - Identify the duration of stays to understand guest booking preferences.
   - Calculate time-based metrics, such as recent bookings within the last 30 days and duration between check-in and check-out.
3. Targeted Filters
   - Filter bookings by high-occupancy (3+ guests) to find group reservations.
   - Segment bookings by room rates and hotel categories to analyze pricing impact.
   - Analyze seasonal trends by extracting the year and month from booking dates.

Recommendations
  - Optimize Room Rates and Promotions: Leverage booking trends by identifying high-demand date ranges and peak room rates, allowing for targeted promotional pricing.
  - Enhance Guest Experience for Larger Groups: High-occupancy bookings indicate group or family travel. Consider offering amenities tailored to these guests.
  - Streamline Data Cleaning and Consistency: Standardize hotel names and guest identifiers in the dataset to improve data clarity, ensuring consistency across analyses.
